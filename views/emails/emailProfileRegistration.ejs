<p>Hi <%= FirstName %>,</p>
<p>Thank you for participating in the Tour of Honor!  We hope you find the experience as rewarding as we've had putting it together.</p>
<p>For 2022 we are excited to announce a brand new Scoring Portal. Please click <a href="<%= URL %>">here</a> to setup your Scoring Portal profile. We strongly recommend doing this now so that you will be all ready to submit your memorials as soon as the tour starts on April 1, 2022.</p>
<p>We suggest bookmarking the <a href="<%= PortalURL %>">Tour of Honor Scoring Portal</a> as you will be using this site to submit your memorial visits throughout the tour.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:dave.brooks@tourofhonor.com">email us</a> or you can ask other riders in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/130290830851907/">Tour of Honor Facebook Group</a>.
